Professional Highlights Defined a formal language class called  visibly pushdown languages  (also called  nested word  languages.  This has had a tremendous impact in academia (see Wikipedia page entries: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_word ). This has not just been widely cited, but has defined a new model that people have extensively studied  (see http://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=&as_oq=%22nested+words%22+%22visibly+pushdown%22 for a Google Scholar search for "nested words" OR "visibly pushdown" that lists more than 940 entries).    The class of visibly pushdown languages is an insertion into the Chomsky hierarchy, falling between regular languages and deterministic context-free languages, but which possesses most closure properties that regular languages have while yet remaining tractable. In particular, the inclusion problem is decidable and this has led to applications ranging from XML processing to program verification to programming languages.
