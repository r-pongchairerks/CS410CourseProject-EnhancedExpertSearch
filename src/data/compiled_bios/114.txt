Research Statement I lead the FORWARD Data Lab group, which is part of the larger Data and Information Systems Laboratories, at the CS department of UIUC. Our research overall aims at bridging structured and unstructured data— to bring structured/semantic-rich access to the myriad and massive unstructured data which accounts for most of the world’s information. Therefore, our research spans natural language processing, data mining, data management/databases, information retrieval, and machine learning. As our objectives, we aim at developing novel systems, principled algorithms, and formal theories that ultimately deliver real-world applications. As our approaches, we seek to be inspired by and learn from the data we are tackling-- i.e., we believe the key to tame big data is to learn the wisdom hidden in the large scale of the data. structured unstructured data natural language processing data mining data management/databases information retrieval machine learning , Natural language processing, data mining, data management, and information retrieval with machine learning techniques, with emphasis on the application areas of Web and social media-based knowledge acquisition and organization across structured and unstructured data.
