After his Ph.D., he was recruited by Arizona State University to help co-found (along with Thanassis Rikakis) the School of Arts, Media and Engineering (AME). AME is a transdisciplinary school that emphasizes scholarship and pedagogy with roots in the arts, design, and engineering. He served as Associate Director for AME (2009-12). He joined the University of Illinois in 2014 as an Associate Professor with a joint appointment between the departments of Computer Science and the Charles H. Sandage Department of Advertising. He received the Eliahu Jury award for best dissertation (2002), IBM faculty awards (2007, 2008), and several best-paper awards and best-paper runner-up honors from IEEE and ACM conferences. He was elected as ACM distinguished scientist in 2019 and IEEE senior member in 2019."", 'School of Arts, Media and Engineering', ""Sundaram's research spans applied machine learning, network science, and human-computer interaction. He develops algorithms and builds systems that help individuals to understand and to act. Constraining system and algorithm design to account for human cognition limits is a central thread in his research. Among his major contributions in Multimedia Computing include a feedback-control algorithm for a ground-breaking, real-time mixed-reality system for stroke patient rehabilitation, which aimed to help stroke survivors re-learn how to reach and grasp objects. Other major contributions within Network Science include algorithms for identifying homogenous communities within large heterogeneous networks, detecting collective behavior, and efficient sampling of large graphs."", 'Sundaram’s current focus is motivated by the need to solve large-scale collective-action problems (e.g., public health; climate change). Collective-action problems require us to confront a fundamental tension:  How do we reconcile an individual’s desire for agency and choice in what they do with the greater common good? Computer Science can facilitate a scaling effect on theories of collective action. He develops algorithms for robust inference of behavior, including systemic bias, designs mechanisms to improve social-welfare, designs algorithms for synthesis of messages, and develops computational infrastructure to enable large-scale field experiments.', 'How do we reconcile an individual’s desire for agency and choice in what they do with the greater common good?', 'Research Areas Data and Information Systems Interactive Computing', 'Research Areas', 'Data and Information Systems Interactive Computing', 'Data and Information Systems', 'Data and Information Systems', 'Interactive Computing', 'Interactive Computing', 'Recent Courses TaughtADV 490 - Computational Advertising CS 412 CSP (CS 412 ONL, CS 412 P3, CS 412 P4) - Introduction to Data Mining CS 469 (ADV 462) - Comp Adv Infrastructure CS 470 - Social and Information Network CS 498 CA3 (CS 498 CA4, CS 498 CAU, CS 498 HS1, CS 498 HS2, CS 498 HS3, CS 498 HS4) - Computational Advertising CS 514 - Adv Topics in Network Science CS 597 HS - Individual Study CS 598 HS (CS 598 HSO) - Adv Social&Information Network', 'Recent Courses Taught', 'ADV 490 - Computational Advertising CS 412 CSP (CS 412 ONL, CS 412 P3, CS 412 P4) - Introduction to Data Mining CS 469 (ADV 462) - Comp Adv Infrastructure CS 470 - Social and Information Network CS 498 CA3 (CS 498 CA4, CS 498 CAU, CS 498 HS1, CS 498 HS2, CS 498 HS3, CS 498 HS4) - Computational Advertising CS 514 - Adv Topics in Network Science CS 597 HS - Individual Study CS 598 HS (CS 598 HSO) - Adv Social&Information Network', 'ADV 490 - Computational Advertising', 'CS 412 CSP (CS 412 ONL, CS 412 P3, CS 412 P4) - Introduction to Data Mining', 'CS 469 (ADV 462) - Comp Adv Infrastructure', 'CS 470 - Social and Information Network', 'CS 498 CA3 (CS 498 CA4, CS 498 CAU, CS 498 HS1, CS 498 HS2, CS 498 HS3, CS 498 HS4) - Computational Advertising', 'CS 514 - Adv Topics in Network Science', 'CS 597 HS - Individual Study', 'CS 598 HS (CS 598 HSO) - Adv Social&Information Network']"

Since 2001,   runtime verification  (RV) has grown into an active and diverse community, with its own international conference.  The underlying idea of RV is to verify a system while it executes, where the system is either instrumented or simulated in an environment in which efficient monitors are generated from specifications and checked against the running system.  Combined with recovery when properties are violated, RV can be used as a scalable alternative to formal verification, yielding the same correctness guarantees but at a cost fraction.  Runtime verification has got significant traction in the formal verification and software engineering communities, where major conferences include special tracks named Runtime Verification.  Within the RV field, Rosu and his collaborators introduced several notions, seminal algorithms and techniques for parametric property monitoring, efficient monitor synthesis, runtime predictive analysis, as well as monitoring-oriented programming as a programming paradigm where a formal specification and an implementation form together a (runtime verified) system.  In 2010, Rosu founded the company Runtime Verification, Inc. , as a vehicle to productize and commercialize RV technology to customers such as NASA, Boeing, Toyota, Denso, as well as emerging companies in the blockchain space such as Ethereum Foundation, IOHK, Tezos, Algorand, Maker, Gnosis, etc.', 'Runtime verification', 'runtime verification', 'Runtime Verification, Inc.', 'The  K framework  was proposed by Rosu together with his FSL lab in 2003, as an executable semantic framework.  Programming languages, type systems and formal analysis tools can be defined uniformly in the K framework, using configurations, computations and rewrite rules.  The distinctive feature of K is that once a system is formalized as a K definition, all the tools needed for that system, from concrete execution engines (interpreters, virtual machines (VMs), compilers) to symbolic execution and formal verification tools, can and should be derived automatically or semi-automatically, correct-by-construction.

His research interests lie in robot planning and control, a field devoted to providing the decision-making capabilities needed for robots and other intelligent agents to perform complex physical tasks. His research builds upon the theoretical foundations of state space dynamics and optimality, but attempts to overcome the shortcomings of classical theory when faced the complexities of real-world systems, such as high dimensionality, uncertain dynamics, bounded computation, and integration with perception and learning. The methodologies at the foundation of this work include optimization, probabilistic methods, AI, control theory, and physics simulation, and theory is bridged with practice on real-world physical robots in the context of a diverse range of applications with social impact, including robot locomotion and manipulation, medical robots, human-operated robots, warehouse automation, and intelligent vehicles.', ""Prof. Hauser received his PhD in Computer Science from Stanford University in 2008, bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics from UC Berkeley in 2003, and worked as a postdoctoral fellow at UC Berkeley.

They are all around us---from the datacenters and clouds we use directly or indirectly every day; to smart devices, smart homes, and smart buildings/cities; to machine learning running inside AI systems online and in the physical world. Yet many common concepts, algorithms, and systems design and implementation techniques, pervade and permeate through many of these seemingly disparate types of distributed systems. Prof. Indranil Gupta (Indy) does research and teaching on these topics. His research is driven by a love of working on real problems (very often motivated by industry), devising solutions with intellectual depth, and then implementing and evaluating them with real testbeds and systems. He also collaborates with industry production teams. His group is one of the most diverse in the CS department. He teaches the world's largest (online) class on distributed systems, apart from regular on-campus teaching.
